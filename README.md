# mindLAMP Project ♥️ Jupyter Notebook

This codespace was created to generate participant reports for the mindLAMP project.  This code will pull data from REDCap and mindLAMP's cortex which will include both active and passive data.  A report will be prepared which overlays participant self report info onto behavioral vital sign data to make for easier interpretation by participant and clinician.  

This code will also provide information on data quality to help digital navigators identify participants who do not have sensors active or are having other issues.
